# 🎧 Modern Glassmorphism Music Player

A sleek, responsive, and feature-rich music player built using **pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, showcasing modern **Glassmorphism** and dynamic content management.

---

## ✨ Features

This player evolved from a basic HTML/CSS template into a fully functional and aesthetic application:

- **Glassmorphism Design:** Beautiful, semi-transparent "glass" cards using CSS `backdrop-filter`.
- **Immersive Background:** Page background dynamically blurs and uses colors derived from the current album art.
- **Dynamic Ranking (Top Hits):** A "Top Hits" section automatically sorts and displays songs based on their real-time play count, with a crown icon (🏆) for the #1 song.
- **Stateful Tracking:** Play counts are persisted in the browser's `localStorage` so your rankings are saved across sessions.
- **Visual Feedback:** Includes a mini-visualizer animation next to the title and a "breathing" album cover when music is playing.
- **Core Functionality:** Integrated volume slider, real-time progress bar, and accurate time displays.
- **Aesthetic Scrolling:** Custom-styled, minimal scrollbars for the playlist section, ensuring a clean UI even with long lists.
- **Full Responsiveness:** Layout seamlessly adjusts from a three-column desktop view to a fully stacked mobile view using CSS Media Queries.
