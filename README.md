#🎧 Modern Glassmorphism Music Player
A sleek, responsive, and feature-rich music player built using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, showcasing modern Glassmorphism and dynamic content management.Shutterstock✨ FeaturesThis player evolved from a basic HTML/CSS template into a fully functional and aesthetic application:Glassmorphism Design: Beautiful, semi-transparent "glass" cards using CSS backdrop-filter.Immersive Background: The page background dynamically blurs and uses colors derived from the current album art.Dynamic Ranking (Top Hits): A "Top Hits" section that automatically sorts and displays songs based on their real-time play count, with a crown icon (🏆) for the #1 song.Stateful Tracking: Play counts are persisted in the browser's localStorage so your rankings are saved across sessions.Visual Feedback: A mini-visualizer animation next to the title and a "breathing" album cover when music is playing.Core Functionality: Integrated volume slider, real-time progress bar, and accurate time displays.Custom Scrollbars: Styled, minimal scrollbars for the playlist section, ensuring a clean UI even with long lists.Full Responsiveness: Layout seamlessly adjusts from a three-column desktop view to a fully stacked mobile view using CSS Media Queries.🚀 Setup and InstallationThis is a front-end project and does not require any build tools or dependencies.Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
